## Progress Log

* Got nlpaug package working. Before running code, make sure to create virtual enviroment "FakeNewsEnv" (or some other name) using the "requirements.txt" file. 
* Organized the files used for the neural networked into a directory. Also organized the .csv files within that into a subdirectory.

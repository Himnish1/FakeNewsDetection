* Got nlpaug package working. Before running code, make sure to create virtual enviroment "FakeNewsEnv" (or some other name) using the "requirements.txt" file. 
* Organized the files used for the neural networked into a directory. Also organized the .csv files within that into a subdirectory.

* Modified nlpaug to only exchange adjectives with synonyms.
* Did more organization, attempted to disambiguate filepaths.
